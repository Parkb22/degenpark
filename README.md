you can install Retype using npm, yarn, or the dotnet CLI.

From your command line, navigate to a folder location where you have one or more Markdown (.md) files, such as a GitHub project.

Next, choose one of the following tools to first install retypeapp and then start Retype by using the retype start command:

+++ NPM

npm install retypeapp --global
retype start
+++ Yarn

yarn global add retypeapp
retype start
+++ dotnet

dotnet tool install retypeapp --global
retype start
+++

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running.

!!! You will require either npm, Yarn, or the dotnet CLI to be installed before installing Retype. Only one of those three is required, although all three could be installed on your machine too. It's up to you. ðŸ™Œ

All operating systems are supported: including Mac, Windows, and Linux. !!!
Retype generates a basic HTML website that you can host on any web hosting service, or for free using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Cloudflare. No special server-side software or external dependencies are required. You can host your Retype site as a public website or as a private website within your organization's network.
