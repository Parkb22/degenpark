# 🌀 Meme Wheel


The **Meme Wheel** is Degen Park’s decentralized spin game, built for the fearless. Using **ORAO's VRF** for provable fairness, players can swap their favorite **meme coins** for a chance to win big.

---

### ⚙️ How Does It Work?

In the **Meme Wheel**, players deposit **meme coins** into a shared pot during the round timer. When the timer runs out:
1. The wheel spins.
2. Your win chance is based on your share of the total pot.
3. The wheel stops, and one lucky winner takes the entire pot.

**No second-place prizes, just glory and riches for the winner.**

### 📋 Example Game Round

Imagine a pot of 100 SOL, with four players contributing meme coins swapped into SOL:

| **Player** | **Deposit**  | **Chance**       |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Alice      | 40 SOL       | 40%             |
| Bob        | 30 SOL       | 30%             |
| Carol      | 20 SOL       | 20%             |
| Dan        | 10 SOL       | 10%             |

The **Meme Wheel** visually represents the chances, with Alice’s share being the largest and Dan’s the smallest. When the wheel stops, the winner takes home the **entire pot** (less a small protocol fee).
